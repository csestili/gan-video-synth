# gan-video-synth
A wrapper around the [BigGAN](https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/biggan-deep-512/1) image-generation model intended for electronic art creators. More to come soon :)

## Using GPU
1. Install CUDA 10.0 (not the newest version, but this is the one that's compatible with this tensorflow version)
2. Download and setup CuDNN

GPU is supposed to be faster than CPU, but looks like that might not be the case. need to run some tests.
